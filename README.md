# Udacity_Investigate-a-Dataset-ProjectIntroduction
In this dataset I would be analyzing an information which is focused on whether or not patients show up for their appointments. This would help to a great deal to understand the factors surrounding the absence or presence of patients for a Doctors Appointment.The dataset has over 110,527 rows and 14 columns. Kindly find below the Dictionary showing the dataset definitions.

QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS


Do we have more patients on some days of the week.

Which gender is more likely to meet their appointment schedules

What is the age distribution of patients for the Noshow appointment

How does the waiting period affect the No Show appointment

Does the availability of a scholarship affect the No Show appointment

Conclusions
The dataset I analyzed is an information that contains over 100 thousand medical appointments in Brazil that is focused on whether patients missed their Doctor's appointment or not. The records have 110,527 rows , 14 columns with about 79.8 % of patients who showed up for their Doctors Appointment and 20.2 % of patients who didnt show up for theirs.

THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED BY THE ANALYSIS

Q1.Is the day of the week a deciding factor for missed appointments?

Yes we can observe closely that Saturday has the highest percentage of missed appointments while Wednesday and Thursday had the lowest percentage which implies to a great deal that the day of the week an appointment is scheduled goes a long way in determining whether the patients would make or miss their appointments.

Q2.Which gender is more likely to meet their appointment schedules?

Even though we had a higher percentage of percentage of females who missed their appointments, it was pretty close call.Based on this data, Gender is not a deciding factor for missed appointments.

Q3.What is the age distribution of patients for the Noshow appointment?

We can see from the data that a majority of those who missed their appointments were under 37 years while most of the aged persons(over 56 years and above) did not miss their Doctor's appointment.

Q4.Does the waiting period affect missed appointments?

A notable observation from the data is that most of the patients who called in to scheduled their appointments on the same day did not miss it while those who scheduled theirs by more than 16 days were more likely to miss their appointment.

Q5.Does the availability of a scholarship affect the No Show appointment?

The patients with scholarship happen to have a higher percentage of missed appointment (albeit slightly) , implying that scholarship is not a deciding factor for missed appointments. ?


This implies that factors such as Waiting period(period between scheduled day and appointment day), age of patients and the day of the week goes a long way in determining the percentage of patients who missed their Doctor's appointment

Limitations of the dataset

1.The description of some of the column values didnt provide enough information. I had to search google for some of them to get a clear description.


2.The dataset only covers a short period of time and does not provide enough information for the analysis.
